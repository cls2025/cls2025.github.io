                  In this work, we will explore modalities through dialogical game lenses. Games provide a powerful
                  tool for bridging the gap between intended and formal semantics, often offering a more conceptually
                  natural approach to logic than traditional
                  model-theoretic semantics.</p>
                <p>We begin by exploring substructural calculi from a
                  game semantic perspective, driven by intuitions
                  about resource-consciousness and, more specifically,
                  cost-sensitive reasoning. The game comes into full
                  swing as we introduce cost labels to assumptions and
                  a corresponding budget. Different proofs of the same
                  end-sequent are interpreted as strategies for a
                  player to defend a claim, which vary in cost. This
                  leads to a labelled calculus, which can be viewed as
                  a fragment of subexponential linear logic. We
                  conclude this first part with a discussion of
                  cut-admissibility for the proposed system.  In the
                  second part, we show that our games offer an
                  interesting insight also into modal logics.  More
                  precisely, we will focus on the modal logic <b>PNL</b>,
                  characterised by Kripke frames with two types of
                  disjoint and symmetric reachability relations. This
                  framework is motivated by the study of group
                  polarisation, where the opinions or beliefs of
                  individuals within a group become more extreme or
                  polarised after interaction. Our approach to
                  reasoning about group polarisation is based on <b>PNL</b>
                  and highlights a different aspect of formal
                  reasoning about the corresponding models – using
                  games and proof systems. We conclude by outlining
                  potential directions for future
                  research.</p>

classical logic with decision trees that is strictly linear. In a strictly linear subatomic system, a single
linear rule shape subsumes not only the structural rules, such as contraction and weakening, but also
the unit equality rules. An interpretation map from subatomic logic to propositional classical logic
recovers the usual semantics and proof theoretic properties. By using explicit substitutions that
indicate the substitution of one derivation into another, we are able to show that the unit-equality
inference steps can be eliminated from a subatomic system for propositional classical logic with only
a polynomial complexity cost in the size of the derivation, from which it follows that the system
p-simulates Frege systems, and we show cut elimination for the resulting strictly linear system.</p></div>

tree-hypersequent system CSGL, and Negri’s labeled sequent system G3GL. Shamkanov provided
proof-theoretic correspondences between GL<sub>seq</sub>, GL<sub>∞</sub>, and GL<sub>circ</sub>, and Goré and Ramanayake showed
how to transform proofs between CSGL and G3GL, however, the exact nature of proof transformations
between the former three systems and the latter two systems has remained an open problem. We
solve this open problem by showing how to restructure tree-hypersequent proofs into an end-active
form and introduce a novel linearization technique that transforms such proofs into linear nested
sequent proofs. As a result, we obtain a new proof-theoretic tool for extracting linear nested sequent
systems from tree-hypersequent systems, which yields the first cut-free linear nested sequent calculus
LNGL for Gödel-Löb provability logic. We show how to transform proofs in LNGL into a certain
normal form, where proofs repeat in stages of modal and local rule applications, and which are
translatable into GL<sub>seq</sub> and G3GL proofs. These new syntactic transformations, together with those

G3GL, and LNGL while also giving (to the best of the author’s knowledge) the first constructive proof
mappings between structural (viz. labeled, tree-hypersequent, and linear nested sequent) systems

                    <p><span class="abstract-title">Abstract.</span> It is well-known that extending the Hilbert axiomatic system for first-order intuitionistic logic with
an exclusion operator, that is dual to implication, collapses the domains of models into a constant
domain. This makes it an interesting problem to find a sound and complete proof system for
first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with non-constant domains that is also conservative over first-order
intuitionistic logic. We solve this problem by presenting the first sound and complete proof system
for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with increasing domains. We formalize our proof system as
a polytree sequent calculus (a notational variant of nested sequents), and prove that it enjoys
cut-elimination and is conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. A key feature of our calculus
is an explicit eigenvariable context, which allows us to control precisely the scope of free variables in
a polytree structure. Semantically this context can be seen as encoding a notion of Scott’s existence
predicate for intuitionistic logic. This turns out to be crucial to avoid the collapse of domains and
to prove the completeness of our proof system. The explicit consideration of the variable context
in a formula sheds light on a previously overlooked dependency between the residuation principle
and the existence predicate in the first-order setting, which may help to explain the difficulty in
designing a sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic.</p></div>

algebraic structure whose operations mediate between the different modalities. The graded “of-course” modality !ᵣ captures how many times a proposition is used and has an analogous interpretation
to the of-course modality from linear logic; the of-course modality from linear logic can be modelled
by a linear exponential comonad and graded of-course can be modelled by a graded linear exponential
comonad. Benton showed in his seminal paper on Linear/Non-Linear logic that the of-course modality
can be split into two modalities connecting intuitionistic logic with linear logic, forming a symmetric
monoidal adjunction. Later, Fujii et al. demonstrated that every graded comonad can be decomposed
into an adjunction and a “strict action”. We give a similar result to Benton, leveraging Fujii et al.’s
decomposition, showing that graded modalities can be split into two modalities connecting a graded
logic with a graded linear logic. We propose a sequent calculus, its proof theory and categorical
model, and a natural deduction system which we show is isomorphic to the sequent calculus system.
Interestingly, our system can also be understood as Linear/Non-Linear logic composed with an
action that adds the grading, further illuminating the shared principles between linear logic and a
class of graded modal logics.</p></div>

One of the main limitations of the <b>PCoh</b> model is that it cannot interpret continuous measures.
To overcome this obstacle, Ehrhard has extended <b>PCoh</b> to a category of positive cones and linear
Scott-continuous functions and shown that it is a model of intuitionistic linear logic. In this work
we show that the category <b>PBanLat₁</b> of perfect Banach lattices and positive linear functions of

a model of classical linear logic (without exponential) and that <b>PCoh</b> embeds fully and faithfully

not just objects, but also morphisms capturing interactions between objects. Of particular importance
in some applications are double categories, which are categories with two classes of morphisms,
axiomatizing two different kinds of interactions between objects. These have found applications in
many areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science, for instance, the study of lenses, open
systems, and rewriting.</p><p>
However, double categories come with a wide variety of equivalences, which makes it challenging
to transport structure along equivalences. To deal with this challenge, we propose the univalence
maxim: each notion of equivalence of categorical structures has a corresponding notion of univalent
categorical structure which induces that notion of equivalence. We also prove corresponding
univalence principles, which allow us to transport structure and properties along equivalences. In
this way, the usually informal practice of reasoning modulo equivalence becomes grounded in an
entirely formal logical principle.</p><p>
We apply this perspective to various double categorical structures, such as (pseudo) double
categories and double bicategories. Concretely, we characterize and formalize their definitions in Coq
UniMath up to chosen equivalences, which we achieve by establishing their univalence principles.

and colimits in the universe (i.e., ordinary colimits). To derive this characterization, we find an
explicit construction of colimits in coslices that is tailored to reveal the connection. We use the
construction to derive properties of colimits. Notably, we prove that the forgetful functor from a
coslice creates colimits over trees. We also use the construction to examine how colimits interact with
orthogonal factorization systems and with cohomology theories. As a consequence of their interaction
with orthogonal factorization systems, all pointed colimits (special kinds of coslice colimits) preserve
n-connectedness, which implies that higher groups are closed under colimits on directed graphs. We

the art for compilation, simulation and verification. In this work, we focus on one of the main carrier
of quantum information and computation: linear optical circuits. We introduce the <b>LO<sub>fi</sub></b>-calculus,
the first graphical language to reason on the infinite-dimensional photonic space with circuits only
composed of the four core elements of linear optics: the phase shifter, the beam splitter, and auxiliary
sources and detectors with bounded photon number. First, we study the subfragment of circuits
composed of phase shifters and beam splitters, for which we provide the first minimal equational
theory. Next, we introduce a rewriting procedure on those <b>LO<sub>fi</sub></b>-circuits that converge to normal
forms. We prove those forms to be unique, establishing both a novel and unique representation of
linear optical processes. Finally, we complement the language with an equational theory that we
prove to be complete: two <b>LO<sub>fi</sub></b>-circuits represent the same quantum process if and only if one can
be transformed into the other with the rules of the <b>LO<sub>fi</sub></b>-calculus.

done to develop a rewriting theory for quantum lambda calculus. Recent advances in the theory of

applies uniformly to many different kinds of classical probabilistic processes. It has so far been
challenging, however, to generalize these techniques to reasoning about quantum processes, as the
quantum no-cloning theorem forbids “copy” maps of the sort that have been used to axiomatize
conditional independence, and the related notions of complete common causes and Markovianity, in
classical Bayesian networks. Here, we introduce a new categorical notion of Markovian causal model,
according to which a distinguished subcategory of “common cause” maps plays a similar role to that
of “copy” maps in the categorical formulation of Bayesian networks. Moreover, defining causal models
as second-order processes yields a clean and flexible formulation of interventions. Our formalism is
both rich enough to handle “complete common cause” assumptions and general enough to encompass
not only standard classical causal identification scenarios, but also quantum causal scenarios and
new kinds of classical causal identification based on imperfect observations. Furthermore, we show
that one can reason uniformly across all of these cases using string-diagrammatic techniques.

                    <p><span class="abstract-title">Abstract.</span> The Kantorovich distance is a widely used metric between probability distributions. The Kantorovich-
Rubinstein duality states that it can be defined in two equivalent ways: as a supremum, based on
non-expansive functions into [0,1], and as an infimum, based on probabilistic couplings.</p><p>
Orthogonally, there are categorical generalisations of both presentations proposed in the literature,
in the form of <em>codensity liftings</em> and what we refer to as <em>coupling-based liftings</em>. Both lift endofunctors
on the category <b>Set</b> of sets and functions to that of pseudometric spaces, and both are parameterised
by modalities from coalgebraic modal logic.</p><p>
A generalisation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality has been more nebulous – it is known
not to work in some cases. In this paper we propose a compositional approach for obtaining such
generalised dualities for a class of functors, which is closed under coproducts and products. Our
approach is based on an explicit construction of modalities and also applies to and extends known
cases such as that of the powerset functor.

lambda-calculi. The main contribution is a particular naturality and simplicity: our probabilistic
types are as simple types, but generated from probabilities as base types, representing a least
probability of termination. Simple types are recovered by restricting probabilities to one.</p><p>
Our vehicle is the Probabilistic Event Lambda-Calculus by Dal Lago, Guerrieri, and Heijltjes,
which presents a solution to the issue of confluence in probabilistic lambda-calculi. Our probabilistic
type system provides an alternative solution to that using counting quantifiers by Antonelli, Dal
Lago, and Pistone, for the same calculus.</p><p>
The problem that both type systems address is to give a lower bound on the probability that terms
head-normalize. Following the recent Functional Machine Calculus by Heijltjes, our development
takes the (simplified) Krivine machine as primary, and proceeds via an extension of the calculus
with sequential composition and identity on the machine. Our type system then gives a natural
account of termination probability on the Krivine machine, reflected back onto head-normalization
for the original calculus. In this way we are able to avoid the use of counting quantifiers, while
improving on the termination bounds given by Antonelli, Dal Lago, and Pistone.

for extensions of first-order logic (FOL). For a given graph property P, the <em>Lindström extension</em>
of FOL by P is defined as the minimal (regular) extension of FOL able to express P. For several
graph properties P (e.g. Hamiltonicity), it is known that the Lindström extension by P is also
able to interpret a segment of arithmetic, and thus strongly disobeys the zero-one law. Common
to all these properties is the ability to express the Härtig quantifier, a natural extension of FOL
testing if two definable sets are of the same size. We prove that the Härtig quantifier is sufficient for
the interpretation of arithmetic, thus providing a general result which implies all known cases of
Lindström extensions which are able to interpret a segment of arithmetic.

Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm distinguishes G from every other non-isomorphic graph, or equivalently,
the least k such that G is definable in (k + 1)-variable first-order logic with counting. The dimension
is a standard measure of the descriptive or structural complexity of a graph and recently finds various
applications in particular in the context of machine learning. This paper studies the complexity of
computing the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension. We observe that deciding whether the Weisfeiler-Leman
dimension of G is at most k is NP-hard, even if G is restricted to have 4-bounded color classes. For
each fixed k ≥ 2, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that decides whether the Weisfeiler-Leman
dimension of a given graph with 5-bounded color classes is at most k. Moreover, we show that for
these bounds on the color classes, this is optimal because the problem is P-hard under logspace-uniform AC₀-reductions. Furthermore, for each larger bound c on the color classes and each fixed
k ≥ 2, we provide a polynomial-time decision algorithm for the abelian case, that is, for structures
of which each color class has an abelian automorphism group.</p><p>
While the graph classes we consider may seem quite restrictive, graphs with 4-bounded abelian
colors include CFI-graphs and multipedes, which form the basis of almost all known hard instances
and lower bounds related to the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.

                    <p><span class="abstract-title">Abstract.</span> Counting logics with a bounded number of variables form one of the central concepts in descriptive
complexity theory. Although they restrict the number of variables that a formula can contain, the
variables can be nested within scopes of quantified occurrences of themselves. In other words, the
variables can be requantified. We study the fragments obtained from counting logics by restricting
requantification for some but not necessarily all the variables.</p><p>
Similar to the logics without limitation on requantification, we develop tools to investigate the
restricted variants. Specifically, we introduce a bijective pebble game in which certain pebbles can
only be placed once and for all, and a corresponding two-parametric family of Weisfeiler-Leman
algorithms. We show close correspondences between the three concepts.</p><p>
By using a suitable cops-and-robber game and adaptations of the Cai-Fürer-Immerman construction, we completely clarify the relative expressive power of the new logics.
We show that the restriction of requantification has beneficial algorithmic implications in terms
of graph identification. Indeed, we argue that with regard to space complexity, non-requantifiable
variables only incur an additive polynomial factor when testing for equivalence. In contrast, for all
we know, requantifiable variables incur a multiplicative linear factor.</p><p>
Finally, we observe that graphs of bounded tree-depth and 3-connected planar graphs can be
identified using no, respectively, only a very limited number of requantifiable variables.

polynomial time, the probability that the attack succeeds is <em>negligible</em>, i.e. that it tends fast enough
to zero with the size of secrets. In order to reason formally about cryptographic truth, one may
thus consider logics where a formula is satisfied when it is true with overwhelming probability, i.e. a
probability that tends fast enough to one with the size of secrets. In such logics it is not always the
case that either φ or ¬φ is satisfied by a given model. However, security analyses will inevitably
involve specific formulas, which we call <em>determined</em>, satisfying this property – typically because they
are not probabilistic. The Squirrel proof assistant, which implements a logic of overwhelming truth,
features ad-hoc proof rules for this purpose.</p><p>
In this paper, we study several propositional logics whose semantics rely on overwhelming truth.
We first consider a modal logic of overwhelming truth, and show that it coincides with S5. In
addition to providing an axiomatization, this brings a well-behaved proof system for our logic in
the form of Poggiolesi’s hypersequent calculus. Further, we show that this system can be adapted
to elegantly incorporate reasoning on determined atoms. We then consider a logic that is closer to
Squirrel’s language, where the overwhelming truth modality cannot be nested. In that case, we show
that a simple proof system, based on regular sequents, is sound and complete. This result justifies
the core of Squirrel’s proof system.

partial orders, as well as over the class of finite, strict partial orders. Nevertheless, we show that the

some chosen notion of behavioural semantics. They allow one to reduce equivalence or preorder
checking to model checking, and are exactly the formulae in the modal logics characterizing classic
behavioural equivalences and preorders for which model checking can be reduced to equivalence or
preorder checking.</p><p>
This paper studies the complexity of determining whether a formula is characteristic for some
process in each of the logics providing modal characterizations of the simulation-based semantics in
van Glabbeek’s branching-time spectrum. Since characteristic formulae in each of those logics are
exactly the satisfiable and prime ones, this article presents complexity results for the satisfiability and
primality problems, and investigates the boundary between modal logics for which those problems
can be solved in polynomial time and those for which they become computationally hard.</p><p>
Amongst other contributions, this article also studies the complexity of constructing characteristic
formulae in the modal logics characterizing simulation-based semantics, both when such formulae
are presented in explicit form and via systems of equations.

                    <p><span class="abstract-title">Abstract.</span> The Homomorphism Preservation Theorem (HPT) of classical model theory states that a first-order
sentence is preserved under homomorphisms if, and only if, it is equivalent to an existential-positive
sentence. This theorem remains valid when restricted to finite structures, as demonstrated by the
author in (Rossman, JACM 2008 and ITCS 2017) via distinct model-theoretic and circuit-complexity based proofs. In this paper, we
present a third (and significantly simpler) proof of the finitary HPT based on a generalized Cai-Fürer-Immerman construction. This method establishes a tight correspondence between syntactic
parameters of a homomorphism-preserved sentence (quantifier rank, variable width, alternation
height) and structural parameters of its minimal models (tree-width, tree-depth, decomposition
height). Consequently, we prove a conjectured “equi-rank” version of the finitary HPT. In contrast,
previous versions of the finitary HPT possess additional properties, but incur blow-ups in the
quantifier rank of the equivalent existential-positive sentence.

(TOCS 2004), we study the parameterized complexity of learning concepts definable in monadic
second-order logic (MSO). We show that the problem of learning an MSO-definable concept from a
training sequence of labeled examples is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded clique-width,
and that it is hard for the parameterized complexity class para-NP on general graphs.</p><p>
It turns out that an important distinction to be made is between 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional concepts, where the instances of a k-dimensional concept are k-tuples of vertices of
a graph. For the higher-dimensional case, we give a learning algorithm that is fixed-parameter
tractable in the size of the graph, but not in the size of the training sequence, and we give a hardness
result showing that this is optimal. By comparison, in the 1-dimensional case, we obtain an algorithm

classical decidability results are preserved.</p><p>
The first extension, MSO[CBrank<sub>β</sub>], is MSO (over the signature of the binary tree) augmented
with the extra ability to express that the subtree over a set X has Cantor-Bendixson rank β, for
some fixed countable ordinal β. We show that this extension is decidable over the binary tree if and
only if β is finite, which means that it is decidable if and only if it is equivalent in expressiveness to
MSO.</p><p>
The second extension, MSO[otp<sub>α</sub>], is MSO (over the signature of order) augmented with the
extra ability to express that the suborder induced by a set X has order type α for some fixed
countable ordinal α. We show that this extension is decidable over countable ordinals if and only if
α < ω<sup>ω</sup>, which means that it is decidable if and only if it is equivalent in expressiveness to MSO.</p><p>
The first result can be established as a consequence of the second. The second result relies on
the undecidability results of the logic BMSO (itself relying on the undecidability of MSO+U) in the
case of αβ for β a limit ordinal, and on entirely new techniques when β is a successor ordinal. We
also have some partial extensions of the second result to some uncountable cases.

in fixed-point logic with counting (FPC) corresponding to many classical complexity results from the
hardness of approximation. In this line of work, NP-hardness results are turned into unconditional
FPC undefinability results. We extend this work by showing the FPC undefinability of any constant
factor approximation of weighted 2-to-2 games, based on the NP-hardness results of Khot, Minzer
and Safra. Our result shows that the completely satisfiable 2-to-2 games are not FPC-separable from
those that are not ϵ-satisfiable, for arbitrarily small ϵ. The perfect completeness of our inseparability
is an improvement on the complexity result, as the NP-hardness of such a separation is still only
conjectured. This perfect completeness enables us to show the FPC undefinability of other problems
whose NP-hardness is conjectured. In particular, we are able to show that no FPC formula can
separate the 3-colourable graphs from those that are not t-colourable, for any constant t.
