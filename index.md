#### Submission guidelines

Submitted papers must be in English and must provide sufficient detail to allow the Program Committee to assess the merits of the paper.
Authors must submit their papers through the CSL 2025 Easychair submission site at [easychair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=csl2025) as a single PDF file.
Full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which will be read at the reviewersâ€™ discretion.
Authors are strongly encouraged to include a well written introduction which is directed at all members of the PC.

The papers should be submitted via easychair (the link will be opened in early June).

The conference proceedings will be published in [Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors).

Authors are invited to submit contributed papers of no more than 15 pages in LIPIcs style (not including references), presenting unpublished work fitting the scope of the conference.
Papers may not be submitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or a journal.

*Papers authored or co-authored by members of the PC are not allowed.*{: style="color: red"}

At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference and attend it in person or online, in order to present their papers.

#### Helena Rasiowa award

The [Helena Rasiowa Award](https://www.eacsl.org/?page_id=1111) is the best student paper award for the CSL conference series, starting from CSL 2022.
The award will be given to the best paper (as decided by the PC) written solely by students or for which students were the main contributors.
A student in this context is any person who is currently studying for a degree or whose PhD award date is less than one year prior to the first day of the conference.
