#### About

[CSL](https://www.eacsl.org/csl-conferences/) is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic ([EACSL](https://www.eacsl.org/)).
It is an interdisciplinary conference, spanning across both basic and application oriented research in mathematical logic and computer science.

CSL 2025 will be held on the 10th–14th of February 2025 and is hosted by the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en).

#### Submission guidelines

Submitted papers must be in English and must provide sufficient detail to allow the Program Committee to assess the merits of the paper.
Authors must submit their papers through the CSL 2025 Easychair submission site at [Easychair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=csl2025) as a single PDF file.
Full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which will be read at the reviewers’ discretion.
Authors are strongly encouraged to include a well written introduction which is directed at all members of the PC.

The papers should be submitted via easychair (the link will be opened in early June).

The conference proceedings will be published in [Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors).

Authors are invited to submit contributed papers of no more than 15 pages in LIPIcs style (not including references), presenting unpublished work fitting the scope of the conference.
Papers may not be submitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or a journal.

Papers authored or co-authored by members of the PC (but not PC chairs) are allowed.

The submissions are **double-blind**:

- Authors are not allowed to put their name on the paper, and they should avoid revealing their identities in text (references to previous or related work should be in third-person).
- Authors are allowed to disseminate the work on public repositories (e.g. on arXiv or their websites).

We ask authors to declare conflicts with PC members when they submit their paper in Easychair.

At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference and attend it in person or online, in order to present their papers.

#### Helena Rasiowa award

The [Helena Rasiowa Award](https://www.eacsl.org/helena-rasiowa-award-2/) is the best student paper award for the CSL conference series, starting from CSL 2022.
The award will be given to the best paper (as decided by the PC) written solely by students or for which students were the main contributors.
A student in this context is any person who is currently studying for a degree or whose PhD award date is less than one year prior to the first day of the conference.

#### Venue

CSL 2025 will take place at [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/en/), the research institute for mathematics & computer science in the Netherlands. The address is [Science Park 123, 1098 XG Amsterdam](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/57861985).

#### Program

Information can be found here at a later stage.  The list of [accepted papers](accepted.html) is now available.

#### Registration

Registration will open on November 14.

#### Hotels

Please beware that hotel rooms in Amsterdam are scarce, due to the CISCO Live 2025 event, that takes place in Amsterdam in the same week as CSL 2025.

There are no hotels in the close vicinity of the conference site. Information on reaching CWI can be found [here](https://www.cwi.nl/en/about/contact/).

Three possible suggestions for booking a hotel:

- Take a hotel in the city center, close to the central railway station. From there you can take a train to Amsterdam Science Park railway station (4 times per hour, takes 9 minutes), which is at walking distance of the conference site.
- Take a hotel close to Amstel railway station or Muiderpoort railway station, and use bus 40, which stops right in front of the conference site.
- Act like the Dutch, and rent a bike.

#### Co-located Workshops

The [12th Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW@CSL 2025)](https://logic-mentoring-workshop.github.io/csl25/)
